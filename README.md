Computational Thinking Practice Tool (CompThink Solver)
About The Project

CompThink Solver is an interactive, single-page web application designed to help students practice and visualize solutions for common computational thinking and programming problems. The tool was developed based on the questions from the "23AID101 Computational Thinking" assignment.

It provides a hands-on approach to understanding algorithms and logic by allowing users to input their own data and see the results instantly, all within a clean, easy-to-use interface.
Features

This tool includes five interactive modules:

    Pascal's Triangle Generator: Creates a left-aligned Pascal's triangle for a given number of rows.

    Simple Interest Loan Calculator: Calculates the monthly payment for a loan and provides a warning if it exceeds a set threshold.

    Strong Number Checker: Determines if a number is a "Strong Number" by showing the sum of the factorial of its digits.

    Sorting Algorithm Visualizer: Provides an animated, step-by-step visualization of Merge Sort and Selection Sort, complete with explanations to help distinguish between them.

    Phone Letter Combinations Generator: Generates all possible letter combinations from a string of digits (2-9), mimicking a phone keypad.

How To Use

This is a standalone web page. No installation is required.

    Download the computational_thinking_tool.html file.

    Open the file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

    Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between the different problem-solving modules.

    Interact with the input fields and buttons in each module to see the solutions.

Technologies Used

    HTML5: For the basic structure of the web page.

    Tailwind CSS: For modern, responsive styling.

    JavaScript (ES6+): For all the interactive logic and algorithm implementations.

The entire application is self-contained in a single .html file for maximum portability and ease of use.
Problem Modules Explained

Each module in this tool directly corresponds to a question from the 23AID101_Assignment 2.pdf file.

    Pascal's Triangle: Solves the problem of creating a left-aligned Pascal's triangle pattern based on user input n.

    Loan Calculator: Implements the logic for calculating a loan's monthly payment using a simple interest formula and flags payments over $1,000.

    Strong Number: Checks if a number is a Strong Number (where the sum of the factorial of its digits equals the number itself, e.g., 145).

    Sort Visualizer: This module was created to help with the assignment question that requires distinguishing between Merge Sort and Selection Sort. It visualizes the sorting process and provides a text-based explanation of their methodologies and complexities.

    Phone Combinations: Solves the classic problem of generating all letter combinations from a given string of digits, as seen on a telephone keypad.

This tool is intended for educational purposes to make learning computational thinking concepts more engaging and interactive.
